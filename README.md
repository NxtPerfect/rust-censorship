# Rust Censorship
censors chosen words from string

## How to use?
call one of the censorship functions, pass in your string that you want to censor, and pass vector containing tuple of rules, first string is what word to change, second represents what word you want to replace it with. Alternatively use censorship that doesn't require a tuple, instead will use char.
