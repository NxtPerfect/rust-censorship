This library should be able to
- [ ] Read rules from vector
- [ ] Check if any of the rules match our String
- [ ] Change words matching rules for chosen string, or stars
- [ ] Change strings to trait objects, so that you can use different structs
OPTIONAL:
- [ ] Configure through .toml
- [ ] Ability to set custom chars as replacement
- [ ] Add cache to store which word position and length to change, and then do it all at once
- [ ] Multithreading
